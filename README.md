A command line tool to generate ascii art given an image. It also has some image processing power, namely to grayscale images. As of now, there's no immediate plan to add further image processing capabilities.

Doing (ctrl and -) or the equivalent on mac or linux can lead to generation of more detailed ascii art, as it changes the display size of the terminal.

Sometimes, valid images that can be opened by other editors will throw an error. This is likely an issue with the image crate than anything.
