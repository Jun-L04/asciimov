hello! this is just notes for me for now
Doing (ctrl & -) increases terminal size and thus gets you a higher resolution ascii art 
this is case sensitive for now, and in the foreseeable future so no .lower() on all the input strings
sometimes, images somehow have corrupt headers and thus cannot be opened (error from image crate as opposed to an local error)
maybe i'd implement something where I will just re-save images that needs processing to ensure validity (as an option through user input arguments)?
